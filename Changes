Revision history for DBIx-MultiDB

0.06    2010-11-23
        Removed the "prefix" parameter from left_join; now we have to add the prefix explicitly in the query.
        Added VERBOSE parameter to left_join.

0.05    2010-11-22
        Fixed undeclared dependencies (thanks, ANDK).
        Use "left_join" instead of "join".

0.04    2010-05-31
        Fixed bug in fetchrow_hasref; don't delete attached key.

0.03    2010-05-30
        Attached table may specify keys as "foreign_key"/"references".
        Accept "join" as an alias to "attach".

0.02    2010-05-29
        Added "prepare" method, so you don't have to specify the base query in the constructor.

0.01    2010-05-29
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world!
